//VARIABLES
//three ways to declare a variable
var myName = "Greg" //this can be use throughout all of our program

let age = 20 //this can be used only in the scope where it is defined

const pi = 3.14 //this can never change

//(you should always put semicolon at the end of lines)

var a; //declaring a variable
var b = 2; //declaring and assigning a variable, actually assigning a value to the variable

var myStr = 'This is a "string quoted variable" okay?'

//string imutability
var sentence = "Jello World";
sentence[0] = "H"; //this is not working, we can't change an individual letter like that
sentence = "Hello World";
